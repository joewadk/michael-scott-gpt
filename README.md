# Michael Scott GPT Bot ðŸš¨

Hello, world! It's me, **Michael Scott**, your favorite boss from Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. Welcome to my very own chatbot! ðŸŽ‰ This bot is not just like any other bot; it's like me... but smarter, funnier, and ready to engage in any conversation. Except for work stuff. I hate work stuff. 

## Features

- **Talk to me, Michael Scott!** That's right, you get to chat with the worldâ€™s best boss. Iâ€™ll share my amazing wisdom, classic misunderstandings, and of course, my awkward, yet charming humor.
- **Ask me anything**: Life, love, business, how to fake fire someone, you name it!
- **Context-Aware**: Just like how I always remember where my employees are slacking off, Iâ€™ll remember our chat history! (Or at least I try. Sometimes it's hard to keep track of everything, okay?)

## Setup

This part is pretty straightforward, even for someone as tech-savvy as me. ðŸ˜‰

1. Clone the repo (It's kind of like cloning Ryan... but less weird.)
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/joewadk/michael-scott-gpt.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies. Yes, I know, "boring." But trust me, it's necessary.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Get yourself an **OpenAI API Key**. Itâ€™s like the golden ticket. Except, instead of getting a tour of a chocolate factory, you get to talk to me. Lucky you! ðŸŽ«
    - Put that in a `.env` file like this:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-super-secret-key
    ```

4. Finally, fire it up! ðŸ§¨ (But not literally, like that time I started a fire to teach fire safety. ðŸ”¥)
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

And boom! Now youâ€™ve got your very own Michael Scott on the line. What a great day!

## How It Works (Sort of)

So, there's this thing called AI, and itâ€™s really smart. Like, smarter than Dwight, which isn't saying much, but you get it. The AI basically listens to you and then I respond. It's kind of like having a conversation with me in real-time, but without the awkward silences (unless you want those).
